It runs deterministic PII and secret-pattern regex checks first, then passes the draft to gpt-4o-mini with a policy prompt.

                  This is a production-architected multi-agent AI platform built to demonstrate what an
                  engineering team would actually ship to handle automated support ticket investigation at scale.
                  It goes well beyond a tutorial: every design decision — durable orchestration, HITL approval,
                  eval-driven quality measurement, and org-scoped multi-tenancy — mirrors patterns used in
                  real AI product infrastructure.
                </p>
                <p className="text-slate-300 leading-relaxed">
                  The system ingests a support ticket, runs eight specialized AI agents across a LangGraph
                  StateGraph, enforces a guardrails policy on the draft reply, routes it to a human reviewer
                  via a 72-hour approval queue, and posts the approved reply via Slack — with a complete audit
                  trail. A built-in eval suite measures agent output quality across four dimensions using an
                  LLM judge and tracks pass rates over time.

                  Most AI demos are stateless prompt wrappers. This one handles the hard parts:
                  durable execution across process restarts, human oversight before messages reach customers,
                  deterministic + LLM-based safety checks, structured observability on every agent call,
                  integration adapters that swap between live and mock without touching agent code,
                  and a rigorous eval loop to catch regressions. These are the decisions that separate
                  a production AI system from a weekend prototype.
